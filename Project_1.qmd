## 1. Research Question
Based on the US Census Bureau’s data retrieved from APIs,
-  Estimate the death rate per 1000 residents in US 2021
-  The household income distribution by different country in US

### Original Data

-   Data was downloaded by using [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/index.html#tidycensus), an R package that allows users to interface with a select number of the US Census Bureau’s data APIs and return tidyverse-ready data frames.

### Data Dictionary

-   Here is a data dictionary for what all the column names mean:   [data dictionary](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/readme.md#data-dictionary)

## 2. Research Question

Based on the U.S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS [@noauthor_cps_nodate]: Which race and sex group earn the most of money every week? What's the trend of the earning over the last 10 years?

### Audience

People who are interested in the labor force and weekly median earnings by race/gender/age group over time in America.[@noauthor_technical_nodate]

### Original data

Data comes from TidyTuesday, which is a weekly podcast and global community activity brought to you by the R4DS Online Learning Community. [Archive of datasets from the 2021 series of *TidyTuesday* events](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021)

In this project, one datasets comes from TidyTuesday would be used. Specifically, we will use the following data from February 23th 2021. To access the data, you need to install the *tidytuesdayR* R package and use the function *tt_load()* with the date of '2021-02-23' to load the data.

```{r}
#| warning: false

# tests if a directory named "data" exists locally
if (!dir.exists(here("data"))) {
    dir.create(here("data"))
}

if (!file.exists(here("data", "tuesdata_earn.RDS"))) {
    tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load("2021-02-23")
    earn <- tuesdata$earn
    employed <- tuesdata$employed
    # save the files to RDS objects
    saveRDS(tuesdata$earn, file = here("data", "tuesdata_earn.RDS"))
    saveRDS(tuesdata$employed, file = here("data", "tuesdata_employed.RDS"))
}

earn <- readRDS(here("data", "tuesdata_earn.RDS"))

#### A image from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

Provided an overview of Blacks in the labor force from 1976 to projected 2016-26. Aging labor force, lower participation rates [@toossi_blacks_nodate]
:::

<img src="images/Percentage_labor_force.jpeg" alt="An overview of Blacks in the labor force" height="430px" width="680px"/>

The Black share of the labor force by age group continues to shift. The labor force share of Blacks ages 55 and older was larger in 2016, and is projected to be larger in 2026, than that of the 16- to 24-year-old group.

### Summarize

Which race and sex group earn the most of money every week? Based on the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects, in the past 10 years, all race groups' weekly earning were increasing. <br>
Specially, Asian had the highest median weekly earning from 2010 to 2020. Black or African American had the lowest median weekly earning from 2010 to 2020. Compared to women, men had higher median weekly earning. In total, Asian men had the highest median weekly earning, Black or African American women had the lowest median weekly earning over the 10 years.
